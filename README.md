# Hand Sign Recognition & Translator

This project uses computer vision and deep learning to recognize hand gestures/signs and translate them into text live.
It is built with Python, OpevCV, Mediapipe, TensorFlow/Keras, and scikit-learn. 

#### Anyone can train their own model, get their own data and use it as their liking even though they don't know how to code!
